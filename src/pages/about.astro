		Hello! I&apos;m {PROFILE.name}, currently based in {PROFILE.location}. I research human-AI collaboration, embodied
		intelligence, and multi-agent systems, always aiming to make technology genuinely useful for human decision-making
		and creativity. I&apos;m also a photographer who enjoys telling stories through images.
	</p>

	<p>
		Photography keeps me observant—the neon lights, strangers passing by at night, and the textures of nature all
		remind me, just like algorithms do, that the key is learning how to interpret complex signals and tell better
		stories. This site is more than a portfolio; it&apos;s a growing digital garden.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe in open knowledge. Tools like TrendRadar and Daily arXiv AI Enhanced will keep evolving in public with
		help from the community. I also turn paper notes, project retrospectives, and behind-the-lens anecdotes into blog
		posts—feel free to reach out anytime.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have ideas about my research focus, photography projects, or tools, drop me a line at
		<a href={`mailto:${PROFILE.email}`}>{PROFILE.email}</a> or open an issue/PR on GitHub. Let&apos;s turn sparks into
		solid work together.
